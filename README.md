## README

This is the whole Blog code after following up [IHP's tutorial](https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/Guide/your-first-project.html), step by step (see commits). 

Just added a few more packages to the nix enviornment as I could not run it from the command line (perhaps I was a bit too inexpierenced with nix.)

## Run the code

open a shell in a system which has [Nix](nixos.org/) installed and run:

```bash
nix-shell
./start
```

## Keywords

Haskell
Haskell web development
Inetgrated Haskell Platform
Inetgrated Haskell Platform Tutorial

## License

Same license as the IHP's documentation, as the whole code has been copies (retyped) from their tutorial.
